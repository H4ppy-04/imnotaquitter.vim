# imnotaquitter.vim

It is designed to correct your bastard ways through positive reinforcement so you too never quit vim like the pros.

It comes with a bonus command, break incase of emergency, only to be used as a last resort when you have no choice but to be a quitter.

Try it out, q!, q, wq, ZZ. See what happens!

There are a list of affirmations to keep encouraging you to never be a quitter.
